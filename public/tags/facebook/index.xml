      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Onavo Protect was the most popular VPN app which helped a lot of users in order to secure their data and also limit the usage of data. It was actually removed on Apple Company’s Appstore last year. Several months after removing this virtual private network (VPN) app from the Appstore, recently Facebook has also removed it from the Google Playstore now. The development of this app comes in the get up of the reaction over the research app of the Facebook that was found paying both adults and teens to track all of their internet activities. Facebook Inc has been involved in one or more data and privacy gossips over the last year and it appear this social network giant is now keenly looking to regain the trust of their public community by just stopping the different data collection activities.
Based on the TechCrunch that was the first platform to report the removal of the Onavo Protect VPN app Android version from the Playstore, this virtual private network (VPN) application will continue to function the current users from the time being to provide them an extraordinary chance to find the necessary replacement of the application. Recently, Gadgets 360 has given a confirmation that this vpn app is no longer listed in the Playstore of the Google. When you are accessing the old listing link, it will throw you a message like “the requested URL or link was not found on this server” error.
TechCrunch also writes that a leading California based company which is named Menlo Park has also stopped hiring the new users for the research app of the Facebook which is now available on the Android. But it was stopped being marketed to the users of the Apple iOS devices after banned on the Appstore. Thus, it cancelled the enterprise certificate of the Facebook and this particular certificate was returned later. Facebook Inc is currently focusing on the different kinds of the paid market research programs where there are huge numbers of participants will exactly know what type of the data they share with the company. This kind of the market research actually helps several firms in order to build the best products or services for the people. The Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch that they are altering their focus to the reward based market research that means that they are ending up the Onavo programme.
Facebook Company has got Israel based Onavo back in October month, 2013 for the reported 150 to 200 millions of US dollars. In those days, this social media leader had this app as the gold mine for having the user data and also it used to data in order to determine the whatsapp as the future acquisition target. But last year in 2018, there are severe privacy concerns regarding this app thus Facebook was compelled to remove the Onavo Protect VPN application from the Appstore first and also continually from the Google Playstore now.
