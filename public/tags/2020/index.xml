      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Computerization to 5G From computerization to 5G to cyber threat, here are the engineering technology trends that have to observe strongly in 2019. Of course, the year 2019 is going to be a lot about the development of the current technologies than about the modernization. For more years, now we have been discussing about completely what is going to occur in 2019. A year ago, we can speak that the future is here to remain. Even the main engineering technology trends are going to be noticeable in all over 2019. In order to experience the modification happens in 2019; the engineers should promote their current skills and also learn about the latest ones, which would support them to team up with the latest technologies in which the engineers are going to implement in their work. The engineers should be at a vanguard of the modernization as well as up-and-coming technologies and also the new technologies have become most essential tools for engineers and designers as well. Some of the go up of unsettling technologies that are situate to take over the industry in the future months are including:
5G connectivity 5G connectivity is going to make feasible the dream 2020. Even, the engineers have to keep an eye on 5G network growths as well as 5G implementation across the globe. 5G connectivity is what is going to influence the whole thing in which the various engineering divisions are going to be working well with the beginning of 2019 and beyond.
Elegant city planning and design In this year 2019, the elegant city design and planning is going to take a longer sight into the outlook. The foremost walk into structuring towards the upcoming is via building an extraordinary infrastructure, which could help the entire elegant city, uses in the present day and tomorrow.
Industry 4.0- The fourth industrial revolution The development of an industrial unit of the future with several robotics and computerization integrated to the process of manufacturing, which takes an approach of incorporated system. The industrial unit modernization just opens the amazing challenges and possibilities in the factory atmosphere. The Fourth Industrial Revolution by Professor Klaus Schwab was introduced in Switzerland at the World Economic Forum in the year of 2016, which gives together physical, digital and biological systems collectively. It is also going to provide all kinds of change at a force, scale and a speed unlike anything you have seen before. Thus, attentiveness becomes more essential.
Internet of Things (IoT) sensors According to the firm Gartner analysis, around 20.4 billion linked things are going to be in use across the globe by 2020. Even, the Internet of Things is commonly known as Internet of Everything, which burdens the quick communication between the sensors in order to function accurately.
Cyber security engineering and threat supervision The cyber security engineers should be aware and also hold the often risk analysis as well as threat assessment at a former state during the development of product and make sure that the security is a powerful characteristic of each product and service as well.
