      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Computerization to 5G From computerization to 5G to cyber threat, here are the engineering technology trends that have to observe strongly in 2019. Of course, the year 2019 is going to be a lot about the development of the current technologies than about the modernization. For more years, now we have been discussing about completely what is going to occur in 2019. A year ago, we can speak that the future is here to remain. Even the main engineering technology trends are going to be noticeable in all over 2019. In order to experience the modification happens in 2019; the engineers should promote their current skills and also learn about the latest ones, which would support them to team up with the latest technologies in which the engineers are going to implement in their work. The engineers should be at a vanguard of the modernization as well as up-and-coming technologies and also the new technologies have become most essential tools for engineers and designers as well. Some of the go up of unsettling technologies that are situate to take over the industry in the future months are including:
5G connectivity 5G connectivity is going to make feasible the dream 2020. Even, the engineers have to keep an eye on 5G network growths as well as 5G implementation across the globe. 5G connectivity is what is going to influence the whole thing in which the various engineering divisions are going to be working well with the beginning of 2019 and beyond.
Elegant city planning and design In this year 2019, the elegant city design and planning is going to take a longer sight into the outlook. The foremost walk into structuring towards the upcoming is via building an extraordinary infrastructure, which could help the entire elegant city, uses in the present day and tomorrow.
Industry 4.0- The fourth industrial revolution The development of an industrial unit of the future with several robotics and computerization integrated to the process of manufacturing, which takes an approach of incorporated system. The industrial unit modernization just opens the amazing challenges and possibilities in the factory atmosphere. The Fourth Industrial Revolution by Professor Klaus Schwab was introduced in Switzerland at the World Economic Forum in the year of 2016, which gives together physical, digital and biological systems collectively. It is also going to provide all kinds of change at a force, scale and a speed unlike anything you have seen before. Thus, attentiveness becomes more essential.
Internet of Things (IoT) sensors According to the firm Gartner analysis, around 20.4 billion linked things are going to be in use across the globe by 2020. Even, the Internet of Things is commonly known as Internet of Everything, which burdens the quick communication between the sensors in order to function accurately.
Cyber security engineering and threat supervision The cyber security engineers should be aware and also hold the often risk analysis as well as threat assessment at a former state during the development of product and make sure that the security is a powerful characteristic of each product and service as well.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Now, everyone knows that 2019 will perceive the authorized presentation of a most exciting technology development in the mobile world such as foldable displays. Even, many shippers and sellers have previously publicized this device, so now it is simply a question of when and how. Still not everyone appreciates that this technology will not essentially come hand-in-hand this year. Presently, many of us see the 5G enabled smart phones with foldable displays. Yet, it is not obvious that we will look the devices that include its potential in this year 2019.
Actually, the primary foldable phone of Samsung will be initiated by past April in Europe. According to the new report, the South Korean colossal anticipated to provide the Galaxy F a suitable declaration on next month during its Galaxy S10 discharged occurrence. But, the Samsung is not only a company that made foldable devices and also end up pending this week, so we imagined that the foldable phone of Samsung will not even have a 5G support. At present, the biggest android competitor of Samsung is creating a foldable handset of its own and this device will come with integrated 5G support. This company also verified that the unidentified phone will be disclosed soon in front of its projected April make public, but you will not be able to purchase it.
More possibly, the Samsung phones are fine attentive of the fact that the Huawei endeavors to sell its primary 5G foldable phone this year and the company just verified the handset would be launched at MWC 2019 upcoming month and just a small number of days after Samsung reveals the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy F. This news comes straightforwardly from the client distribution of Huawei leader named as Richard Yu, who spoke about a latest product commence in Beijing. The Huawei also publicized the Balong 5000 5G chip, which would struggle straightforwardly adjacent to the Snapdragon X50 5G modem.
However, this handset will not be available from the US dealers, when Huawei is still not greeting in the country. Yu also said that at this occasion, which he anticipates to take a number one spot of Samsung in the mobile dealing occasion without even contact to the US market as fast as this year. As per the most widespread report accepting the real 5G chip that Huawei exposed, the Huawei will also begin a 5G phone, which would cost beneath $1, 000. It is indistinct that whether the foldable handset will strike that cost point, or whether this is a second 5G handset coming from the Huawei on this year.
The primary 5G handset of Samsung will be a difference of the Galaxy S10 plus and also it is expected to sell for about $1, 500 as per the latest records. However, this initial foldable phone from the Korean colossal will be very costlier with whispered costs going throughout the way up to $2, 000. According to the new report from Sam Mobile, the 5G version of foldable handset from Samsung will launch in Korea this year.
