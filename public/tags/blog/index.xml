      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Many people in the competitive technology sector have raised their concerns over the changes that India proposed to the intermediary guidelines of the Information Technology Act. India may loss the chance to emerge as the best global hub for the advanced data analytics when it proposes something to weaken the overall legal safeguards already given to the tech intermediaries like cloud companies are finalized.
Analytics hub Anant Maheshwari, Managing Director of Microsoft India revealed the fact associated with Government’s plan for amendments in the Information Technology Act. This is because such act and amendments to such act directly and indirectly affect the nation in various ways. These elements include, but not limited to the law enforcement cooperation on data, traceability of every message and take down requests.
You may think that all such rules are only targeted at well-known social media platforms. On the other hand, the government included every technology intermediary like the cloud companies under their scope. Once the state or central governments issued the orders associated with such intermediaries, there is no improvement in the investments in emerging areas such as data analytics. A proper implementation of the judicial overview is very important to deal with this case in the successful manner. The nation has to concentrate on how to attract investments in particular global investments in its emerging areas like data analytics.
Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad, Union Minister for Electronics and IT said that India must become data analytical hub. Though he expects that the nation to be the hub for the data analytics worldwide, there are an ever-increasing number of requirements to understand difficulties associated with it. Everyone has to send their valuable data to the nation and work with all such data in the nation. State officials throughout the nation can do anything with valuable data of people and businesses. There is a question that why somebody has to send their data to the nation. This question must be answered by the government who has a plan to enhance efforts to make the nation for the global data analytics hub.
Focus on favorable and unfavorable things Amazon Web Services and Nasscom ensured that the intermediary rules of the nation should apply only to companies in the social media sector and not every technology intermediary. Companies in the business process management, IT and cloud platforms do not come under such rules. These new intermediaries under the existing proposals do not fail to bear the cost of complying with all provisions which do not suitable to companies like the Amazon Web Services and Nasscom.
Experts in the tech companies these days focus on different aspects of data rules. They consider and focus on the technology policy which must not be framed factoring in any case with some companies do harm to the nation. This amendment might end up the overall stifling innovation in the rest. Important components like safety and trust become questionable after such amendments. It is the best suitable time to think about whether overt and strong regulation or self-regulation is required. An effective law is vital to improve the nation in terms of the business and welfare of residents on a regular basis.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Onavo Protect was the most popular VPN app which helped a lot of users in order to secure their data and also limit the usage of data. It was actually removed on Apple Company’s Appstore last year. Several months after removing this virtual private network (VPN) app from the Appstore, recently Facebook has also removed it from the Google Playstore now. The development of this app comes in the get up of the reaction over the research app of the Facebook that was found paying both adults and teens to track all of their internet activities. Facebook Inc has been involved in one or more data and privacy gossips over the last year and it appear this social network giant is now keenly looking to regain the trust of their public community by just stopping the different data collection activities.
Based on the TechCrunch that was the first platform to report the removal of the Onavo Protect VPN app Android version from the Playstore, this virtual private network (VPN) application will continue to function the current users from the time being to provide them an extraordinary chance to find the necessary replacement of the application. Recently, Gadgets 360 has given a confirmation that this vpn app is no longer listed in the Playstore of the Google. When you are accessing the old listing link, it will throw you a message like “the requested URL or link was not found on this server” error.
TechCrunch also writes that a leading California based company which is named Menlo Park has also stopped hiring the new users for the research app of the Facebook which is now available on the Android. But it was stopped being marketed to the users of the Apple iOS devices after banned on the Appstore. Thus, it cancelled the enterprise certificate of the Facebook and this particular certificate was returned later. Facebook Inc is currently focusing on the different kinds of the paid market research programs where there are huge numbers of participants will exactly know what type of the data they share with the company. This kind of the market research actually helps several firms in order to build the best products or services for the people. The Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch that they are altering their focus to the reward based market research that means that they are ending up the Onavo programme.
Facebook Company has got Israel based Onavo back in October month, 2013 for the reported 150 to 200 millions of US dollars. In those days, this social media leader had this app as the gold mine for having the user data and also it used to data in order to determine the whatsapp as the future acquisition target. But last year in 2018, there are severe privacy concerns regarding this app thus Facebook was compelled to remove the Onavo Protect VPN application from the Appstore first and also continually from the Google Playstore now.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Many technologies behind the advancements made in the mobile technology are based upon light. It does not include visible light like display lighting or flash lighting. Nowadays 3D sensing technologies are used in mobile phones and it is the latest advancement made in phones. It is an ocular technique behind smartphone face recognition and it depends on optical components. The importance of face recognition has brought 3D optical sensing technology an important one. This involves three techniques for face recognition supported by optical components and techniques.
VC SEL technology for face recognition Gesture recognition shows how invisible infrared light is used in mobile devices. VCSEL is Vertical cavity surface-emitting laser that combines the use of both LED and laser. This technology is used in biometrics. It is the most reliable and secures access for user identification. This is the best method when compared with password management for mobile security and increased authentication. Biometrics uses human characteristics such as facial features or fingerprints.
VCSEL is used in smartphones, drones that needs high speed modulation. VCSEL technology is used in 3D sensing. Higher powers can be generated using VCSEL arrays. It has the ability to emit tons of continuous wave with thousand emitters. The beam is reduced in this when the emission comes from a larger area while the divergence equals to single emitter. Such devices are capable of generating high output and very efficient.
Mobile 3D sensing Mobile 3D sensing includes structured light and time of flight. The recent smartphones uses structured light with projector that produces infrared lights on the face. The infrared camera receives light reflected back from the face to create a 3D facial landscape. It is also used in autofocus functions in cameras. 3D sensing is combined with AR and VR for using in mobile devices. Since it has many advantages relatively low costs, optical efficiency, low power consumption and stability the VCSEL technology is a key factor for using in application such as 3D sensing.
In mobile face recognition a depth map captured by the phone’s 3D sensor is compared to a reference 3D image of the user. This 3D depth map generates more data when compared with 2D camera. The 3D sensing is used in enabling face recognition that requires secure authentication. There are various techniques in making a facial depth map as mentioned below.
Time of flight sensing In this method the distance is measured based on the timing of light from the emitter to user’s face and back to sensor.
Stereo imaging Like in human vision two spaced sensors create perspective and depth. Infrared light projectors work with no ambient light.
Structured light In this method algorithms generate depth maps by analyzing the distortions in patterns of dots on the user’s face. 3D sensing technology is used in mobile phones for face recognition. This is the most secure way because it uses biometric form for identification. So there is no chance for any misconceptions in using the device. Unauthorized access to the phone is avoided in a great way. So this technology is very helpful in the recent innovations and safe to use the gadgets.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Now, everyone knows that 2019 will perceive the authorized presentation of a most exciting technology development in the mobile world such as foldable displays. Even, many shippers and sellers have previously publicized this device, so now it is simply a question of when and how. Still not everyone appreciates that this technology will not essentially come hand-in-hand this year. Presently, many of us see the 5G enabled smart phones with foldable displays. Yet, it is not obvious that we will look the devices that include its potential in this year 2019.
Actually, the primary foldable phone of Samsung will be initiated by past April in Europe. According to the new report, the South Korean colossal anticipated to provide the Galaxy F a suitable declaration on next month during its Galaxy S10 discharged occurrence. But, the Samsung is not only a company that made foldable devices and also end up pending this week, so we imagined that the foldable phone of Samsung will not even have a 5G support. At present, the biggest android competitor of Samsung is creating a foldable handset of its own and this device will come with integrated 5G support. This company also verified that the unidentified phone will be disclosed soon in front of its projected April make public, but you will not be able to purchase it.
More possibly, the Samsung phones are fine attentive of the fact that the Huawei endeavors to sell its primary 5G foldable phone this year and the company just verified the handset would be launched at MWC 2019 upcoming month and just a small number of days after Samsung reveals the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy F. This news comes straightforwardly from the client distribution of Huawei leader named as Richard Yu, who spoke about a latest product commence in Beijing. The Huawei also publicized the Balong 5000 5G chip, which would struggle straightforwardly adjacent to the Snapdragon X50 5G modem.
However, this handset will not be available from the US dealers, when Huawei is still not greeting in the country. Yu also said that at this occasion, which he anticipates to take a number one spot of Samsung in the mobile dealing occasion without even contact to the US market as fast as this year. As per the most widespread report accepting the real 5G chip that Huawei exposed, the Huawei will also begin a 5G phone, which would cost beneath $1, 000. It is indistinct that whether the foldable handset will strike that cost point, or whether this is a second 5G handset coming from the Huawei on this year.
The primary 5G handset of Samsung will be a difference of the Galaxy S10 plus and also it is expected to sell for about $1, 500 as per the latest records. However, this initial foldable phone from the Korean colossal will be very costlier with whispered costs going throughout the way up to $2, 000. According to the new report from Sam Mobile, the 5G version of foldable handset from Samsung will launch in Korea this year.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[WhatsApp has recently released an update for its Apple iPhone app which provides you a fix for the newly found bug which allowed any person to bypass the Face ID or Touch ID screen lock. With the help of the version number 2.19.22, the iphone users can have the updated WhatsApp for your smart phone and now it is available on the Appstore. Everyone is highly recommended updating your iphone based whatsapp immediately with this app. As this instant messaging application has not shared an updated change log in the Apple Appstore, it is not actually familiar if this new update provides you any additional features, improvements or bug fixes.
Early days of this week, a user of the Reddit found that the implementation of the biometric authentication in the whatsapp had a bug which allow any user get access to this application without going through the face id or touch id. Later, the whatsapp developer company confirmed the availability of this bug in the statement given to the Gadgets 360 and also promised to release the fix as quick as possible. They have done what they promised and now this fix is available in the Appstore for the iPhone users. Anyone can install the new update and can confirm that it really fixes the bug.
Whatsapp had also included the support of biometric authentication to its new version of the updated iphone app in early February, 2019. This new iphone whatsapp provides an ability to lock your WhatsApp with the Face ID or Touch ID to all the iphone users. It happens only based on which is available in your phone. Whatsapp bug only worked when you had chosen the biometric authentication kick in time to anything except an option of immediately. But at the same time, you can have the various options there such as after 1 minute, after 15 minutes and after 1 hour. According to your requirements, you can select anyone of this kick-in time to activate the bug.
The bug actually activated when you tried to use the share option of the whatsapp probably in the iphone share sheet. Rather than asking for the authentication using the face id or touch id, whatsapp on the iphone devices simple allow the users share what they desired. Similarly if the user jumped to your mobile home screen from the share sheet of the iOS, you will be allowed to open the whatsapp without having any interference from the authentication of the touch id or face id.
This biometric authentication in the latest whatsapp version is now available only for the Apple iOS iphone devices. With the face id or touch id, the iphone users can lock or unlock your whatsapp application for achieving the maximum security on your data. But Whatsapp for Android doesn’t now have this kind of the biometric authentication feature so the Android users will not have any impacts of bug.
