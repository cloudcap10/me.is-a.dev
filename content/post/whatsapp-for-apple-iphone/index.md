WhatsApp has recently released an update for its Apple iPhone app which provides you a fix for the newly found bug which allowed any person to bypass the Face ID or Touch ID screen lock. With the help of the version number 2.19.22, the iphone users can have the updated WhatsApp for your smart phone and now it is available on the Appstore. Everyone is highly recommended updating your iphone based whatsapp immediately with this app. As this instant messaging application has not shared an updated change log in the Apple Appstore, it is not actually familiar if this new update provides you any additional features, improvements or bug fixes. 

Early days of this week, a user of the Reddit found that the implementation of the biometric authentication in the whatsapp had a bug which allow any user get access to this application without going through the face id or touch id. Later, the whatsapp developer company confirmed the availability of this bug in the statement given to the Gadgets 360 and also promised to release the fix as quick as possible. They have done what they promised and now this fix is available in the Appstore for the iPhone users. Anyone can install the new update and can confirm that it really fixes the bug.

Whatsapp had also included the support of biometric authentication to its new version of the updated iphone app in early February, 2019. This new iphone whatsapp provides an ability to lock your WhatsApp with the Face ID or Touch ID to all the iphone users. It happens only based on which is available in your phone. Whatsapp bug only worked when you had chosen the biometric authentication kick in time to anything except an option of immediately. But at the same time, you can have the various options there such as after 1 minute, after 15 minutes and after 1 hour. According to your requirements, you can select anyone of this kick-in time to activate the bug.

The bug actually activated when you tried to use the share option of the whatsapp probably in the iphone share sheet. Rather than asking for the authentication using the face id or touch id, whatsapp on the iphone devices simple allow the users share what they desired. Similarly if the user jumped to your mobile home screen from the share sheet of the iOS, you will be allowed to open the whatsapp without having any interference from the authentication of the touch id or face id. 

This biometric authentication in the latest whatsapp version is now available only for the Apple iOS iphone devices. With the face id or touch id, the iphone users can lock or unlock your whatsapp application for achieving the maximum security on your data. But Whatsapp for Android doesnâ€™t now have this kind of the biometric authentication feature so the Android users will not have any impacts of bug.
