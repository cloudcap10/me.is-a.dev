Many people in the competitive technology sector have raised their concerns over the changes that India proposed to the intermediary guidelines of the Information Technology Act. India may loss the chance to emerge as the best global hub for the advanced data analytics when it proposes something to weaken the overall legal safeguards already given to the tech intermediaries like cloud companies are finalized.  

# Analytics hub  

Anant Maheshwari, Managing Director of Microsoft India revealed the fact associated with Governmentâ€™s plan for amendments in the Information Technology Act. This is because such act and amendments to such act directly and indirectly affect the nation in various ways. These elements include, but not limited to the law enforcement cooperation on data, traceability of every message and take down requests.  

You may think that all such rules are only targeted at well-known social media platforms. On the other hand, the government included every technology intermediary like the cloud companies under their scope. Once the state or central governments issued the orders associated with such intermediaries, there is no improvement in the investments in emerging areas such as data analytics. A proper implementation of the judicial overview is very important to deal with this case in the successful manner. The nation has to concentrate on how to attract investments in particular global investments in its emerging areas like data analytics.  

Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad, Union Minister for Electronics and IT said that India must become data analytical hub. Though he expects that the nation to be the hub for the data analytics worldwide, there are an ever-increasing number of requirements to understand difficulties associated with it. Everyone has to send their valuable data to the nation and work with all such data in the nation. State officials throughout the nation can do anything with valuable data of people and businesses. There is a question that why somebody has to send their data to the nation. This question must be answered by the government who has a plan to enhance efforts to make the nation for the global data analytics hub. 

# Focus on favorable and unfavorable things  

Amazon Web Services and Nasscom ensured that the intermediary rules of the nation should apply only to companies in the social media sector and not every technology intermediary. Companies in the business process management, IT and cloud platforms do not come under such rules. These new intermediaries under the existing proposals do not fail to bear the cost of complying with all provisions which do not suitable to companies like the Amazon Web Services and Nasscom. 

Experts in the tech companies these days focus on different aspects of data rules. They consider and focus on the technology policy which must not be framed factoring in any case with some companies do harm to the nation. This amendment might end up the overall stifling innovation in the rest. Important components like safety and trust become questionable after such amendments. It is the best suitable time to think about whether overt and strong regulation or self-regulation is required. An effective law is vital to improve the nation in terms of the business and welfare of residents on a regular basis.
