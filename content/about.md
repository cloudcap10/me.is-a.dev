Hey, there! My name is ⭐️ Joven ⭐️. I’m a seasoned IT professional who’s two biggest passions are server and network security. Here you will find some of my tech notes and some references. Good cybersecurity is one of today’s biggest tech trends. Despite being such a popular topic, though, too many people are either unfamiliar with what good cybersecurity consists of, or are reliant on bad cybersecurity systems. Feel free to send me an email if you like.

My website is filled with information that will solve both of those problems for you. You will, by reading what’s on my website, learn all about cybersecurity, different security systems, web hosting, cloud hosting; among a plethora of other topics, all of which pertain to running a strong and secure website.
