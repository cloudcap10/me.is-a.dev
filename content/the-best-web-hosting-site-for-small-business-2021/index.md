The best web hosting site for small business

Finding the right host for your needs is the first step towards publishing a brand-new website. For Web hosting, there are several different choices. The best one will depend on the kind of site being built. Nearly all pages would fall into one of the next three categories: personal or hobby sites, small business sites, high-traffic sites, or e-commerce. It will be the size, complexity, and expected traffic load of the site that will need to be considered when shopping for a host. Multiple sites offer the best web hosting services for small businesses in the market. Services in this company let its users host their website with ease and efficiency by availing the best and simplest business web hosting user interphase.  By hosting your small business website, companies should ensure that their customers get 24-hour customer support to ensure that all their problems are solved on time and facilitate reliable convenience.

When creating a plan for small business web hosting, there are multiple factors to consider for such to make the experience the best and reliable. An example is seen where there is a difference in network-based hosting and cloud plan options. All this consideration depends on web users' needs and desires for their websites. Majorly A2 Hosting is the best option for cloud plans and the best website hosting for small businesses. For business websites that experience spikes and dips in traffic and efficiency, cloud hosting's scalability and versatility are ideal. Picking a trustworthy hosting provider is important for small business website owners, as the choice made will have a major effect on sales and customer satisfaction and the suitability of your websites in meeting the clients' needs. 

Small business sites are sites that contain simple company data. "Typically, these sites are called "brochure sites." This is because a paper promotional brochure can be found with the details on the website. These are fairly easy sites, but the developer would want a stable host because they are still a company and will not be shut down suddenly. The creator chooses his domain name that best suits his business. This hosting service comes in varying packages where the user chooses the package their need for their web hosting. Some common packages include internet service providers, free web hosting sites, and premium site hosting packages. The first is your internet service provider, as most of them, as part of their daily service, offers customers access to a private web page. However, this option has strict limitations on the amount of bandwidth that the site can use; too many photos can drive the website over the limit. Free web hosts are the second choice. This makes it possible for anyone to get a free site, and the host gets to advertise on it, while storage and download amounts are still a problem here. With this option, if it exceeds the bandwidth allowance, the host can shut down the website until the next month when the bandwidth counter restarts.

Another available web hosting option for small businesses is Ecommerce site hosting. These are sites where small and growing businesses can sell their service online and collect their payments for the services they offer. These sites may become a little expensive when trying to find a host since these sites will require a working shopping cart system, an online retailer account, and a web host that supports all of that.
In this paper, I am going to analyze and compare two web hosting companies that are Hostgator.com and hub web hosting. These companies mainly offer web hosting services. The feature characterizing this companies' services are;

HOSTGATOR.COM

•	A subscription fee of $4.95 per month
•	Unlimited data storage space and bandwidth 
•	No restriction of the number of domains one can have	
•	Unlimited Databases
•	Other secondary software integrations supported include; Fantastico Installer, MySQL+ PHP hosting, and also they support ruby on rails frameworks
•	Their services have access to SSH
•	Full-time customer support services
•	Also, there is an Instant Backups in case of data loss or damage

HUB WEB HOSTING

•	A monthly subscription fee of $3.95 
•	They offer Unlimited Bandwidth  and Disk Space
•	They don't experience downtime transfers 
•	Unlimited Domains can be hosted
•	Their customers get to enjoy a free Blogging Software
•	Also, their package comes with a Website Builder
•	They offer unlimited mail slots that support MySQL5, PHP5, and Perl5
•	Integrated E-commerce Tools can be accessed freely
•	Full-time customer support 

Hostgator.com is the first hosting site. For $4.95 a month, this site provides site hosting, including unlimited storage space and unlimited bandwidth. For $3.95 a month, Hub web hosting provides site hosting that includes unrestricted disk space and unlimited bandwidth. Each of them provides many extras, such as infinite domains. The difference is that a basic web hosting site is Hub web hosting, while a little more advanced is hostgator.com. For my website, I would consider using hub web hosting as it seems to be more for the novice website developer and seems to be simpler than the other one.
